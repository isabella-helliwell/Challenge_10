# Mission to Mars
# 1. Project
  The aim of this project is to add additional information and images to an exsisting web app about Mars.
  For this, we will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and their titles.
  This data is stored on a Mongo database. We also create a web application using FLASK to display the data. The last part of this project
  is to alter some designs of the web app.
